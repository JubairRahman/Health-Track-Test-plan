## Test Techniques
- Smoke Testing: Smoke tests will be used in the pre-QA test cycle(s). Functional tests
will be started when the system will pass the smoke test cycle. Some smoke
test cases may be repeated in the QA test cycle(s).
- Functional Testing: Validate that each feature of the HealthTrack application performs its intended functionality.
- Retesting and Regression Testingâ€“ Execution of test cases specifically
designed to retest failure conditions that have previously been identified
within the application. Retesting and regression testing can take place in any
test cycle (QA or UAT) when faults were encountered during an earlier cycle
within that group.
- Usability Testing: Assess the application's user-friendliness, ease of navigation, and overall user experience.
- Data validation testing: All the application data will be validated with the database CRUD testing approach.
- API integration testing: API testing will focus on whether API is doing the task it is supposed to do.
- Browser Compatibility Testing - The purpose of cross-browser testing is to
provide consistent behavior and experience across all browsers, devices, and platforms.
- Recovery Testing- Under Recovery testing testers will check whether the
application or software behaves and recovers correctly when there is a failure.
- Performance Testing: Evaluate the application's response time, scalability, and resource usage under normal and peak loads.
- Security Testing: Identify any vulnerabilities or security gaps within the application.
- Compatibility Testing: Verify that the application functions correctly across different devices, browsers, and operating systems.
